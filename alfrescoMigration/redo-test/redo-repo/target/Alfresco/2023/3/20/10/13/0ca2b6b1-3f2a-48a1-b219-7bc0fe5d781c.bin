Convolutional�Neural�Networks

Before�Deep�Learning

• Convolution�filter를 활용하여
hand-crafted�feature�추출

In�Deep�Learning

• 𝑥 → 𝑦의관계의학습에서필요한
feature를 추출하기위한
convolution�filter를 자동학습



vs�Fully-connected�Layer

• 매우빠르고적은 weight�parameter를 가짐

• 입출력크기가계산이까다로워, 네트워크구성이쉽지않다.
• 3×3커널을활용하면그래도좀낫다.

Wrap-up

• Computer�vision�분야에서 CNN을뗄수없는존재

• 패턴인식에서워낙월등함을보여주므로, NLP 등의다른분야에도활발히사용됨
