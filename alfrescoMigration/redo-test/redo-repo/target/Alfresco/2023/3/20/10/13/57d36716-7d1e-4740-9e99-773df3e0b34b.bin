입출력크기계산방법 (+pad)



Convolution�Layer의 특징

• Feature의 위치에구애받지않는다.



Convolution�Layer의 장점

• 같은입출력을갖는 FC�Layer에 비해더적은 weight를 가진다.



Convolution�Layer의 장점

• 병렬계산구성이쉬우므로, GPU에서의연산이매우빠르다.



Convolution�Layer의 단점

• FC�Layer에 비해입출력크기가계산이까다로워, 네트워크구성이쉽지않다.



Summary

• 예전부터영상처리분야에서는 Convolution�Filter를 활용
• 탐지하고자하는패턴에따라필터를손으로하나하나깎아구성

• CNN은데이터셋의 𝑥와 𝑦의구성에따라자동으로탐지해야할패턴을추출
• 따라서내부 kernel은 해당패턴을추출하기위한형태로자동으로구성됨

• FC�Layer에 비해매우빠르고적은 weight�parameter를 가짐
