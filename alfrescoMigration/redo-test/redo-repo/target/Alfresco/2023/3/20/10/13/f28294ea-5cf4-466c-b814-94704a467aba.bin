Random�Variable & Probability�Distribution

• 어떤변수 x가 𝑥라는값을가질확률
• 확률분포 (함수)

• 입력: 확률변수 x
• 출력: x가각값에해당될때에대한확률값



Discrete�Probability�Distribution

• 확률값의총합은 1

• Probability�Mass�Function�(확률질량함수, PMF)



Continuous�Probability�Distribution

• Probability�Density�Function�(확률밀도함수, PDF)
• 면적의합이 1
• 함수값이 1보다클수있다.

• 연속확률변수의경우, 어떤샘플이주어졌을때, 확률값을알수없다.



Joint�Probability

• 결합분포



Conditional�Probability

• 조건부확률분포

• 좀더친해져야할형태



Bayes�Theorem

• 데이터 𝐷가주어졌을때, 가설 ℎ의확률



Function?�or�Value?
